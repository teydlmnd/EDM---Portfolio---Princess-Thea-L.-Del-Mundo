## About me
I’m a 19-year-old first-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems, with a strong passion for coding and problem-solving. Currently, I’m focusing on sharpening my skills in C and Python, and I’m eager to explore their practical applications in software development, process automation, and data management. I’m driven by my curiosity about how technology influences our world, and I’m constantly motivated to learn and innovate.

Throughout my studies, I’m excited to dive deeper into key areas like systems analysis, databases, and programming to understand how various components of technology interconnect to drive progress. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can exchange ideas with my peers and contribute to team projects, as I believe that sharing knowledge and working together pushes the boundaries of what we can accomplish.

My long-term goal is to establish a strong foundation in Information Systems and leverage my skills to create innovative solutions that improve efficiency and drive success in the tech industry. I’m excited about the journey ahead, and I look forward to growing, collaborating, and making a meaningful impact in the world of technology.
